# LED_brightness
This repository includes controlling the LED brightness with a potentiometer using an Arduino board.

Step one:
Install the Arduino IDE

Step two:
Potentiometer Connections:
1-The middle potentiometer is connected to pin A0 on the Arduino board.
2-The left side of the potentiometer is connected to pin 5V on the Arduino board.
3-The right side of the potentiometer is connected to the GND on the Arduino board.


LED Connections:
1-The shorter leg of the LED is connected to the resistor.
2-The other side of the resistor is connected to the GND on the Arduino board.
3-The longer leg of the LED is connected to pin 6 on the Arduino board.

Step four:
upload the code to the Arduino board.

output:
